            <p>Remember when you were 8 years old, and a single summer afternoon seemed to last for eternity? Compare that to today, where entire months seem to disappear in a blink. This phenomenon is almost universal, and scientists have proposed several fascinating theories to explain it.</p>

            <h2>The Proportional Theory</h2>
            <p>The most famous explanation was proposed by French philosopher Paul Janet. He suggested that our perception of time is relative to the absolute length of our lives.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you are <strong>5 years old</strong>, one year represents <strong>20% of your entire existence</strong>. It is a massive chunk of time.</li>
                <li>When you are <strong>50 years old</strong>, one year is only <strong>2% of your life</strong>. It feels insignificant by comparison.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Mathematically, as you age, each unit of time becomes a smaller fraction of your total experience, making it feel shorter.</p>

            <h2>The "New Experiences" Theory</h2>
            <p>Neuroscientist David Eagleman proposes that our brains encode time based on the density of new information. When you are young, everything is new—learning to ride a bike, your first day of school, your first heartbreak. Your brain records these events in high definition, making the memories feel long and rich.</p>
            <p>As we age, we settle into routines. The commute is the same, the job is the same, the weekends follow a pattern. When the brain encounters familiar information, it writes less data to memory. "Routine," Eagleman argues, "is the enemy of time." To slow down time, you must force your brain to process novelty—travel to a new place, learn a new skill, or even just drive a different route to work.</p>

            <h2>Biological Degradation</h2>
            <p>A more biological theory suggests that our internal clocks literally slow down. Dopamine production drops as we age, and dopamine is key to our perception of time intervals. Similarly, our metabolic rate slows. Research on children shows that their hearts beat faster and they breathe faster; their "biological clock" ticks at a higher Hz rate than adults. To a child, the world moves slowly because their internal processor is running fast. To an adult with a slower metabolic clock, the world appears to zoom by.</p>

            <h3>How to "Stop" Time</h3>
            <p>While you can't stop the clock, you can manipulate your perception of it. The secret is <strong>Novelty</strong>. Step out of your routine. The more unique memories you create, the longer your life will feel in retrospect.</p>

            <p>We often use the term "biological clock" to refer to fertility, but in chronobiology, it refers to the <strong>Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)</strong>. This tiny bundle of 20,000 neurons in your hypothalamus controls your circadian rhythm, a roughly 24-hour cycle that governs every cell in your body.</p>

            <h2>6:00 AM - 9:00 AM: The Cortisol Spike</h2>
            <p>Before you even wake up, your body releases cortisol to prepare you for the day. Blood pressure rises sharply. This is why heart attacks are most common in the morning—the cardiovascular system is ramping up from idle to full speed.</p>

            <h2>10:00 AM - 2:00 PM: Peak Cognitive Performance</h2>
            <p>This is the golden window for deep work. Your body temperature is rising, and alertness is at its peak. If you have a difficult problem to solve, do it now. Do not waste this time on emails.</p>

            <h2>2:00 PM - 3:30 PM: The Post-Lunch Dip</h2>
            <p>It's not just the food coma. Your circadian rhythm has a natural dip in the afternoon. Evolutionarily, this might have been a time for our ancestors to rest out of the hot sun. Fighting it with caffeine is common, but a 20-minute "nappuccino" (coffee followed immediately by a nap) is scientifically proven to be more effective.</p>

            <h2>7:00 PM - 9:00 PM: Highest Body Temperature</h2>
            <p>Your reaction times and physical strength peak here. Olympic records are biologically more likely to be broken in the late afternoon/early evening than in the morning.</p>

            <h2>The Blue Light problem</h2>
            <p>Your SCN is reset by light entering the eye. In the modern world, phone screens emit blue light (460-480nm) which mimics the midday sun. Staring at your phone at 11 PM tells your biological clock it is noon, suppressing melatonin production and destroying your sleep quality. The single best thing you can do for your health? No screens 60 minutes before bed.</p>

            <p>The average human life expectancy is around 80 years. It sounds like a long time. But when you convert 80 years into weeks, the number becomes shockingly small: <strong>4,160 weeks</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>If you are 25, you have already used <strong>1,300 weeks</strong>.</p>
            <p>If you are 40, you have used <strong>2,080 weeks, over half your supply.</strong></p>

            <h2>The "Free Time" Fallacy</h2>
            <p>We often assume we have plenty of time "later." But writer Oliver Burkeman points out that we treat time like a limitless resource, whereas it is the only strictly limited resource we have. Unlike money, you cannot earn more time.</p>

            <h2>The "Tail End" Concept</h2>
            <p>Tim Urban from Wait But Why visualized this famously. If you visit your parents twice a year and they are 60, you might think you have "20 years" left with them. But mathematically, if you see them twice a year for 20 years, you have <strong>40 visits left.</strong></p>
            <p>If you have a customized daily routine (coffee, scrolling), you will do it thousands of times. But unique experiences—trips to the ocean, reading a specific book, planting a garden—might only happen a handful of times in your remaining weeks.</p>

            <h3>How to Use This Data</h3>
            <p>Don't let this depress you. Let it liberate you. If you only have 2,000 weeks left, do you really want to spend this one worrying about what a stranger thought of your Instagram post? The math of mortality is the greatest filter for what actually matters.</p>
